# Unsupervised Learning

**Description:**

There is a set of data that is **not labeled**  with the correct answers  to learn from.
The result of a supervised learning model is to predict new values or understand the relationship between the label and feature variables.

**Variables:**
  + features
 

**Types of algorithms:**
+ **Clustering:** 
  + Predict a category. Classification models classify input data into categories
  + e.g. k-nearest neighbors, Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, support vector machines
+ **Association:**
  + Predict continuous responses by investigating the relationship between the dependent and independent set of variables
  + e.g. Linear regression, Polynomial regression, Decision trees, random forests
