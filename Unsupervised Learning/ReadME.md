# Unsupervised Learning

**Description:**

Involves finding structures and relationships from inputs. There is a set of data that is **unlabeled** to learn from.
The result of an unsupervised learning model is to place observations from a dataset into (1) specific clusters or (2) to create rules to identify associtions between variables. 

**Variables:**
  + features
 

**Types of algorithms:**
+ **Clustering:** 
  + Finding similarities/patterns in observed data
  + e.g. k-means, SVD, PCA, Hierarchical custering
+ **Association:**
  + Identify sequences. Identify new and interesting insights between different objects in a set.
  + e.g. Frequent Pattern-Growth, Apriori Algorithm
