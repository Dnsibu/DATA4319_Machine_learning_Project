    "Reinforcement learning differs from traditional supervised and unsupervised learning in a very distinct way. Reinforcement learning deals with solving [sequential decisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_decision_making).To demonstrate this, suppose your trying to program an algorithm to play an opponent in tic-tac-toe. Under supervised learning the algorithm would take in a feature vector and map that with either regression or classification. So as you play the game on and on, any move you make early in the game may affect how well you do later on in the game. So here there is an ordered sequence of operations and standard supervised machine learning cannot deal with that. Therefore, we need to think if this game as a sequence of decisions and that's where reinforcement learning comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is just as old as the supervised and unsupervised machine learning technique. It was first worked on by [Bellman](https://www.informs.org/Explore/History-of-O.R.-Excellence/Biographical-Profiles/Bellman-Richard-E) in the 1950s, and this was with relation to dynamic programming. It's also closely related to [Markov decision processes](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-the-markov-decision-process-mdp-8f838510f150).\n",
    "Reinforcement learning was originally formulated under optimal control theory and Markov decision processes. So what's the general idea behind Reinforcement learning? \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. How does Reinforcement learning work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, given an environment and an agent (the thing that's going to move around in the environment) acting in the environment, the agents chooses actions (one at a time). Once an agent makes an action, the environment will accept this action(s) and then it transitions to its next state. We can think of a state as an observation on the environment. So going back to our example, the environment was the tic-tac-toe board, and I am the agent who chose to put an \"o\" in the middle of the board and once I choose that action the environment is updated and the next state is a picture of the board with an \"o\" in the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when an agent makes an action it changes the environment or can change the environment and that change in the environment regardless if it actually does change or not  gives you a new state. So new action new state and moreover for each action that the agent chooses to do, this new state then gives the agent a reward.  \n",

    "So each time the pole sets back to the middle part it's failing. So from episode 0 until solved= True, it's trying to learn,according to gradient ascent, the best weights on the policy network that maps the states to actions that are giving it the most reward. In this notebook I run 300 episodes , and thus on average the rewards increases and then balances out much better than it did when it originally started, so this tell us that it's learning. In my case the pole balances out first at episode 87 with a total of 200.0 rewards and this is with a gamma choice (scaling factor) at 0.99. I consider a  different scaling factor, 0.95, to see how it behaved. The results show that it had an easier time learning at first because the pole balanced out much quicker , with  it first being solved at episode 47 with a total of 200.0 rewards but utimately at episode 299, it did solve the task."
