k-Nearest neighbors is one of the simplest supervised machine learning algortithm there is. This algorithm can be used to solve classification, regression, and search (reccomendations) problems. It makes no mathematical assumptions, and it doesn’t require any sort of heavy machinery. 

The only things it requires are:

•	Some notion of distance
•	An assumption that points that are close to one another are similar

Pros:
+ 1. Can be used for classification, regression, and search problems
+ 2. Simple and easy to implement
+ 3. No optimization of parameters
    
Cons:
+ 1. slow
+ 2. Sensitive to high dimension feature vectors and high volume of data
