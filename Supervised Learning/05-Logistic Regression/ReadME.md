## What is Logistic Regression?
Logistic Regression is a popular statistical model used for binary classification, that is for predictions of the type this or that, yes or no, A or B, etc. Logistic regression can, however, be used for multiclass classification, but here we will focus on its simplest application. It is one of the most frequently used machine learning algorithms for binary classifications that translates the input to 0 or 1.
