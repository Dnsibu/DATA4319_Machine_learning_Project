# Linear Regression

## What is Linear Regression?

Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is applied to **real valued** target functions in order to predict a range of possible outputs for a given input.

Linear Regression is the simplest algorithm in machine learning, it can be trained in different ways, however in this notebook I'll be using the closed form of linear regression.

## How does Linear Regression work?

A simple introduction to the closed form of linear regression for machine learning in the notebook file with an example given using the Julia programming language.
