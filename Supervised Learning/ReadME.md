**Description:**
There is a set of data that is labeled (a class or value ) with the correct answers  to learn from.
The result of a supervised learning model is to predict new values or understand the relationship between the label and feature variables.

**Variables:**
  + features
  + labels

**Types of algorithms:**
+ **Classification:** 
  + Predict a category. Classification models classify input data into categories
  + e.g. k-nearest neighbors, Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, support vector machines
+ **Regression:**
  + Predict continuous responses by investigating the relationship between the dependent and independent set of variables
  + e.g. [Linear regression](https://github.com/Dnsibu/NsibuD_DATA_4319/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning/03-Linear%20Regression/linear_regression.ipynb), Polynomial regression, Decision trees, random forests
