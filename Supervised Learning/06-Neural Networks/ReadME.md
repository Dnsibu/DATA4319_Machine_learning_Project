# Neural Networks

## What are neural networks?
Neural networks are inspired by biological neurons in the brain. If you take a look at the picture below, on the left you see a picture of a biological neuron. You see dendrites, a nucleus, and an axion.

In the biological model, dendrites will feed through signals to the nucleus and those signals will stimulate the nucleus and activate a signal that passes through the axions. Depending on the strength of those signals the axion will fire.

When we design some computational unit to model this, we call it an artifical neuron. We have inputs that go into the dendrites with weights that tell the nucleus how to fire. So through combinations and linking together of artifical neurons we hope to mimic the process of learning in the brain.
