## Course Description
This senior level data science course blends the predictive perspective of statistical pattern recognition as well as the algorithmic perspectives of machine learning. Topics include, but are not limited to: essential components of learning, feasibility of learning, linear models (the perceptron learning algorithm, linear regression, logistic regression), deep neural nets, stochastic gradient descent, and modeling with TensorFlow (and Flux).
